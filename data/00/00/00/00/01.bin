  |   Welcome to Fujisawa Academy - an educational institution where        |
  |   nothing is as it seems and every pupil hides a dark secret. Having    |
  |   made a pact with a demon fox - and bestowing you with the power to    |
  |   see the truth behind the lies, you must infiltrate the secretive      |
  |   Fujisawa Academy and uncover the sinister truths behind the           |
  |   seemingly normal facade.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A brand new IP in collaboration with Japanese studio, ART Co. Ltd,    |
  |   PQUBE is turning the classic high school Visual Novel on its head     |
  |   with a brand new story and universe where absolutely nothing is as    |
  |   it seems. Part investigative Visual Novel, Part Puzzle game - PQUBE   |
  |   takes classic genres and fuses them into something altogether         |
  |   unique.                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Investigate the secrets of Fujisawa Academy across seven chapters   |
  |     of Visual Novel - where each chapter hides the truth to each of     |
  |     the seven mysteries                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Battle key character using 'Kotodama' - the power of words.         |
  |     Interrogation battles see you stripping your target naked - to      |
  |     expose the truth behind the lies                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Uncover key words in the games's investigation phase. The more      |
  |     keywords and clues you find, the more potent your power in the      |
  |     puzzle phase                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Nothing is as it seems! Kotodama intentionally plays on classic     |
  |     tropes and cliches to continually twist the story and surprise      |
  |     the player                                                          |

  |   * Repeated play throughs will yield new facts within the story.       |
  |     Uncover them all to unlock the true ending and a full gallery of    |
